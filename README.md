# JavaScript Frameworks Assignment 4
An exercise in creating a pixel perfect version from a mockup image, and adding a function. I chose to recreate this colorful design about the National Read a Book Day and by clicking a button you can switch out almost every piece of text on the site with a random Wikipedia entry using the Wikipedia API.

## What I Learned
This was the second time recreating a site form a mockup but the aim was to create a "pixel perfect" version so I tried my best and worked a lot with the CSS. After finding the random Wikipedia Entry API endpoint I wanted to use it somewhere and it worked for this small exercise. It bugs me to this day that it's not responsive but it wasn't part of the assignment.
